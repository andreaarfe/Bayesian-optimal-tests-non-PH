# Bayesian optimality of testing procedures for survival data in the non-proportional hazards setting
Programs to replicate the analyses of the paper "Bayesian optimality of testing procedures for survival data in the non-proportional hazards setting".

To re-run all analysis, just run 
```
make all
```
using [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

Contents:
* ./digitized survival curves/ - raw input data
* ./programs/ - programs to run the simulations and prepare Figures 1a-c
* ./datasets/ - generated datasets
* ./results/figure_phase3_post_plot.pdf - Figure 1a
* ./results/figure_phase2_pred_power.pdf - Figure 1b
* ./results/figure_sensitivity.pdf - Figure 1c
