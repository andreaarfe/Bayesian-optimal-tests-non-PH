# Optimality of testing procedures for survival data in the non-proportional hazards setting
Programs to replicate the analyses of the paper "Optimality of testing procedures for survival data in the non-proportional hazards setting" (Arf√® A. et al., Biometrics 2020; https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00161).

To re-run all analysis, just execute 
```
make all
```
using [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The results presented in the manuscript were prepared using `R` version 3.5.1.

Contents:
---------

* ./digitized survival curves/ - raw input data
* ./programs/ - programs to run the simulations 
* ./datasets/ - generated datasets
* ./results/ - numerical results and figures
